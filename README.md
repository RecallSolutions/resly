Residence tracking.

This system was designed to learn more about the students in our first year residence. 
The project was developed as an exploratory entry to Semantic-UI.

Due to the information being handled, security was important to this project. It was developed using server side rendering to minimize the "controllable" data the client has access to.
It demonstrates the use of two factor authentication, requiring a valid university email address to access and view. This uses the institute as a source of authority, offloading verification concerns indirectly.
